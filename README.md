Code Refactor Description
This project had multiple <div> elements placed in spots that semantic elements would be more useful for the purpose of SEO searches.

In order to make this page visible in a search engine, the code needs semantic elements. Instead of utilizing the div feature, it needed clear elements such as a header, sections to divide the page, an aside bar and a footer.

The descriptions above each element state what each code does for the client to understand the code if they'd like to make simple changes or to ensure they do not change the code.
